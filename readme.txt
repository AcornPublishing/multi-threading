Express Logic's ThreadX for Win32 Demo Using Visual C/C++

This demo program is intended for use with the book titled
"Real-Time Embedded Multithreading: Using ThreadX and ARM"
by Edward L. Lamie.



1.  Installation
    The ThreadX Win32 demo appears in Zip form on this CD. To install the demo on your
    hard disk, do the following:

    Extract all files to a hard disk location of your choice, but make certain that you
    specify the "Use Folder Names" option.



2.  Running the ThreadX Demonstration

    To run the ThreadX Win32 demo, open the ThreadX workspace file (ThreadX.dsw). When you
    first open this workspace, you will see the source file 02_sample_system.c -- compile,
    build, and run this program.

    Following are the C source files located in this folder:
       02_sample_system.c
       07_sample_system.c
       09_sample_system.c
       10a_sample_system.c
       10b_sample_system.c
       11_sample_system.c
       12_sample_system.c
       14_sample_system.c
       demo.c

4.  The source file demo.c is a test program that uses all ThreadX resources. The other
    other source files appear in the various chapters of the book.
